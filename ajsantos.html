			I remember mornings when my head didn't hurt <br>
			And I remember nights when art didn't feel like work <br>
			She wakes up at noon and she's out 'til three <br>
			She leaves her perfume all over me <br>
			But I remember mornings when my head didn't hurt</p>
		<p id = "explanation">Explanation: <br>
		There’s hope in the song entitled This City. The bridge is 'she got a hold on me, she got me wrapped around her finger.' So it’s like, even though I feel this way, I still have this love and I know that I am meant to be here. But right now I’m having a really tough time. The song was my life getting out of that dark place.</p>
