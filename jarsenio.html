			Lights will guide you home <br>
			And ignite your bones <br>
			And I will try to fix you</p>
		<p id = "explanation">Explanation: <br>
		This song by Coldplay; Fix You is all about an attempt for a soul healing process. A cry for help when knowing it's a dead end and checkmate for him. All he got are hope and faith that keep him moving. The more and harder he tries, the worse the situations came up to be. The only solution is "light" which us is God or higher power of him will eventually guide us home and ignites our bones such as will and spirit. I think the important aspect of the song is the word "try". The beauty of the love is that the person loves the person so much that their pain is theirs, however they know there is no way to fix that kind of hurt in your life. But the point of the song to me is that the person is not looking for a quick fix, they're offering themselves up for the other person, and there is no greater love then putting yourself in full force, without any limitations for someone else.</p>
